<body> <h2>INF-3201 Parallel Programming</h1> <h1>Assignment 3: Dessert
Map and Race Trap using CUDA</h2>

  <h3>The Assignment</h3>

  <p>Solve the Mandelbrot Set (in Assignment 1) and the Traveling
  Salesman Problem (in Assignment 2) using <a
  href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/gpucomputing.html"> Nvidia
  CUDA </a>. Algorithms used in this assignment don't need to be the
  same as those used in Assignments 1 and 2. Use Nvidia CUDA Visual
  Profiler to analyze your implementations. Compare the performance of
  your implementations using CUDA with the performance of your previous
  implementations using MPI (for Mandelbrot Set) and Cilk++  (for
  Traveling Salesman Problem). </p>

  <p>We also like to benchmark your solutions a bit against each other
  to learn about how your particular choices perform: we will give you
  suitable problem parameters during the course of the assignment so you
  can test your implementations with these specific configurations.</p>

  <p>A report should be made that describes the various choices that
  have been made, as well as individual techniques that have been
  applied to improve performance. The performance impact of each the
  applied techniques should be documented. In addition, the scalability
  of your implementation and the achieved performance should be
  discussed.</p>

  <h3>Optimization</h3>

  <p>Any optimization may be applied, but the result should be correct
  (i.e. give a reasonable answer) and independent of the number of
  nodes/cores that are used to achieve the solution. Any optimization
  that is applied must be thoroughly described.</p>

  <h4>Hand-in</h4>

	<p>You must follow the instructions given in the first group session
	(slides available on fronter), just like in the previous two
	assignments. If the requirements given there are not met, the
	hand-in will <i>not</i> be accepted.</p>

    <p>The deadline is Thursday, November 15th, 23:59.</p>
